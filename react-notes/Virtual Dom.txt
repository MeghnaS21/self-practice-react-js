REACT CREATES VIRTUAL DOM IN MEMORY & WITHOUT UPDATING THE DATA INTO ACTUAL DOM, IT JUST UPDATES THE DATA INTO VIRTUAL DOM 
AND LATER ON, IT WILL UPDATE IT INTO REAL DOM

EXAMPLE --->

VIRTUAL ---> JUST AN IMAGINARY FRIEND, THAT DOESN'T EXISTS

SIMPLE STORY --->

      ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS ON PAPER ==> DOM
      CLIENT HAS APPOINTED YOU TO DESIGN FOR HIM
      YOU ARE HAPPY BECAUSE YOU HAVE FINALLY COMPLETE THE DESIGN

      TWIST--> NOW THE PHONE RINGS AND YOU HAVE TO UPDATE THE DESIGN, ONCE YOU STRUCTURE THE DESIGN, YOU HAV TO UPDATE THE ENTIRE DESIGN
      BUT THE GOOD THING IS YOU HAVE SOME SELECTORS WITH YOU LIKE getElementById, getElementByIdByClassName & using this you started updating your design...

      AGAIN, YOU'VE COMPLETED THE ENTIRE DESIGN

      PHONE RINGS AGAIN, NOW YOU'RE AFRAID TO SIT FOR HOURSE BUT YOU HAVE SELECTORS, SO YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE DESIGN BUT AGAIN PHONE RINGS & THIS HAPPENS REPEATEDLY...

      DUE TO THIS YOU WILL FORGET THE SELECTORS, BUT YOU ARE A HARDWORKING PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP FOR HIS CLIENT,

      SOMEHOW YOU GOT, MAGICAL PENCIL..

      MAGICAL PEN ====>>>> """"REACT VIRTUAL DOM"""", GIFTED FOR YOUR HARDWORK.

      SO IF THE CLIENT DEMANDS FOR AN UPDATE, THIS VIRTUAL DOM WILL UPDATE THE PARTICULAR SECTION & LATER ON WILL UPDATE THE ENTIRE DESIGN.

      NOW YOUR CLIENT IS ALSO VERY HAPPY!!!
